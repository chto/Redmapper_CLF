Please note that this REAME file is currently incomplete.

While most of this set of redmapper analysis code is
self-contained within Python, it DOES require access to
IDL if absolute magnitudes for galaxies are not supplied.
By default, it will call kcorrect to get these.

USAGE:

General usage is:

python redm_full.py some_parameter_file

redm_full.py is the main call part of the script.  All 
parameters for running should be specified within the
parameter file.  There are several parameter files included
in the repository.

Depending on settings, the code has the capability to 
calculate n(z), n(lambda), CLFs, and radial profiles.

Magnitude gap measurements are present but incomplete.

Note that this version currently has some issues with
bootstrap selection and error calculations.  Use with
caution.

####DESCRIPTION OF INPUT PARAMETER FILES####

use_p_ext:
	0: No correction to probabilities.
	1: Use p_ext instead of p, with correction.
           Only valid for redmapper <=v5.9
	2: Use p_ext instead of p, with correction.
	   Exclude galaxies outside of rvir.
	   Only valid for redmapper <=v5.9
	3: Use p_ext instead of p, with correction.
	   Excludes galaxies outside of r_lambda and with p_corr < 0.2.
	   Only valid for redmapper <=v5.9
	4: Use p*pfree, with correction.  Only valid for DR8 and
	   redmapper >=v5.10.  r<r_lambda cut included.
	5: Use p*pfree, with partial correction.  Valid for S82 (?) 
	   and requires redmapper >=v5.10.  r<r_lambda cut included.
